# Tic Tac Toe

## Project Overview

### The Brief

#### The rules are as follows:

- There are two players (X & O)
- Players take turns until the game is over
- A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
- A turn ends when a player claims a field
- A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
- A game is over if a player wins
- A game is over when all fields are taken

## Design Approach

### Tech Stack

I am going to use Node.js. Further developments to come with regards to testing framwork and further tech needed.
